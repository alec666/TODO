Rich Healey @ 15:09 Potentially, I'll see what I can hack up
I had an idea for a distributed reverseproxy a while ago
depending on how I go I might see if I can pull it off this weekend.. it'd be a pretty badass concept

Josh Benham @ 15:10https://github.com/jwilger/github-v3-api/blob/master/github-v3-api-get-token <â€” they spin off sinatra lol

  File "/home/developer/projects/python/github/github_cli/actions/issues.py", line 31, in execute
      url = url + '?' + urllib.urlencode(get)
      AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'urlencode'

      Rich Healey @ 15:10 basically a webservice that accepts a connection on a given port, accepts a key, and then when a client connects back to the url specified in the key it connects the sockets
